Tic Tac Toe

Two players will take turns choosing a spot from a 3x3 grid. 
Player 1 goes first and chooses a spot.
    That spot is placed with an 'X'
Second player goes next and chooses a spot.
    That spot is placed with an '0'
It will loop until one player gets 3 in a row

1. Make a 3x3 Gameboard
    - Gameboard has to look like tic tac toe game board
2. Create two players 
    - Player one goes first and is assigned as the 'X'
    - Player two goes second and is assigned to the 'O'
3. Player 1 chooses a spot to put the 'X' by asking for user input 1-9
    - Create a method for when player inputs a number 1-9, it changes the char to 'X'
4. Player 2 chooses a spot to put the 'O' by asking for user input 1-9
    - Same method can be used as in part 3
5. Steps 3-4 needs to be repeated until we have a winner or all empty spaces are filled
    - Loop steps 3 and 4 and add a check to make sure spots havent been taken
